# Predictive Analysis of Skin Type and Personalized Acid Recommendations for Effective Skin Care using ResNet-50

## Overview

This project presents an AI-powered web application designed to predict *skin types* (Normal, Oily, Dry, Combination, Sensitive) and recommend *personalized acid skincare routines. The model utilizes the **ResNet-50 architecture, which overcomes the limitations of traditional CNN models by incorporating **residual connections* for better feature extraction and accuracy.

With an impressive *accuracy of 93.12%*, this system provides a reliable method for classifying skin types and offering tailored skincare routines.

## Workflow

The system follows this vertical workflow:

- *Data Collection & Analysis*: Gather and preprocess images of human faces.
- *ResNet-50 Model Architecture*: Use the ResNet-50 model, which includes 50 convolutional layers with ReLU activation and batch normalization.
- *Training & Testing: The dataset is split into **65% training, 25% testing, and **10% validation* to ensure robust model training.
- *Evaluation & Output Generation*: The model evaluates the predictions, providing users with the predicted skin type and a personalized skincare routine.

## Features

- *High Accuracy: Achieves **93.12%* accuracy using the ResNet-50 architecture.
- *Real-Time Prediction*: Upload a face image, and the system predicts the skin type and recommends a skincare routine.
- *Personalized Recommendations*: Based on the skin type, the system suggests appropriate acid-based products for skincare.

## How to Use

1. *Upload an Image*: Choose an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format containing a human face.
2. *Prediction*: The system will process the image and predict the skin type.
3. *Personalized Routine*: After prediction, a recommended skincare routine is generated based on the skin type.
